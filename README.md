# CAD-Hotkeys
Tired of AutoCAD being useless by not having any usefull hotkeys? No? 
Don't care + didn't ask + L bozo.
This is here to stay, so far it's only layer and shape hotkeys, if you have any sugestions message them to me

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING

First, download AutoHotkey. I'll assume you downloaded and unzipped a .zip 

Here: https://www.autohotkey.com/download/

## Option 1

Make a Script folder, I made mine in the AutoHotkey folder, but you can make yours anywhere

Download the scripts here and set the files to open with AutoHotkey

If you want to know what each file does, open it in a text editor and read the first lines that start with ";"

## Option 2

Download the most recent release

Set the .exe files to run with autohotkey

##

Ultimately this is just me playing developer, this repo basically only exsists so that I can figure out how all this works

If you have any suggestions, leave them wherever you want.
